# So, a mobile app?

The whole purpose of this [site](https://abigailloosle.github.io/soundboard/) was to build a mobile application that was built according to the best mobile application standards. I didn't want the user to have to scroll or worry about loading pages.

### What now?

Now that it's not just a mobile app and is on the web, I want to make it work on both desktop and mobile. While its a relatively small project, I am passionate about JavaScript and will continue to work on this app.

If you have any suggestions, I'd be happy hear them!
