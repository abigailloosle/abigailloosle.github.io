## A Little About Me

I am currently a senior studying Web Design and Development, with an emphasis on Development. I love being able to bring a design to life through responsive code. I am passionate that powerful code must be backed up with strong design.

### How I Design

Some of my main tools include Adobe XD to wireframe and plan sites. I often use Adobe Illustrator to design, format, and create icons and any SVG content I might need to accomplish my page!

I almost always design something, then take a break. This is so that when I come back, I can look at my design with fresh eyes and make any changes I need!

## How I like to code

Everyone has their own way of doing things. Here is a bit about my process.

### Start building

With wireframe, and images in hand, I find that some of the most important things to do is set up the environment. I prefer coding in VS Code and using SASS, because together I can code with flexibility.

### Test in different browsers

One of the strengths of SASS is in Mixins. These are powerful ways to make a site responsive and make the code easy to follow.

Every browser has their quirks and I find it incredibly important to have tested the site on as many as possible, so I can better understand my visitor's experience.

### Then I Share It

This is a vital step in the process to get feedback on different individual's experiences. And as neccessary, make improvements!
