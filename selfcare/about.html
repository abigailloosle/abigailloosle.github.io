        <h1>Let me introduce myself</h1>
        <p>My name is Abby. I am a senior in college and I, like so many other students get stressed, stay up too late, and
          <em>do it all over again</em> the next day. </p>
        <p>Life doesn't get less busy,
          <em>only more.</em> I don't have it
          <b>all</b> figured out, but I do have
          <b>some</b> tips. That's why I made this website, as a place to not only share what I know with others, but to remind
          myself of the princples of what caring for yourself can do in your life!

        <h2>Why SelfCare</h2>
        <!-- breaking up paragraphs so it is easier to read -->
        <p>Well, why not? Why not take time for yourself? You should.</p>
        <p>I think self care is something that would, if put in to practice, help the lives of so many people. It's something
          I think about often.</p>
        <p>It's not something that has to cost a lot of money or take a lot of time. It should be something you make time for.
          That's all it costs, is your own time. Plus, it's so worth it.
