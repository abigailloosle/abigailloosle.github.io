                    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
                    <p>Fruits are some of the most diverse foods on the planet! You can have sweet, bitter, sour, strong, or
                        tart fruit. It all depends on your taste.

                    <h3>The science behind it</h3>
                    <p>Most people aren't getting enough healthy food in their lives. Especially when faced with a stressful
                        situation. Fruits are not only a great source of minerals, but they also are full of water too. Dehydration
                        and hunger can lead to stress becoming even more intense than neccessary. So snack up! And you can
                        snack virtually guilt free!

                <h2>Pick up a book</h2>
                <div class="time">
                    <p>Prep time: 5 min</p>
                    <p>Fun time: how ever long you want!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="what">
                    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
                    <p>The prep time consists of finding a book! You can look through your physical bookshelf or grab an ebook.
                        The point is to pick a book that you can
                        <em>lose yourself</em> inside of!
                    </p>

                <div class="science">
                    <h3>The science behind it</h3>
                    <p>When you think about how turned on our brains are all day, it's no wonder that we get tired. Lots of
                        people, myself included, think that by watching shows or videos online that we are giving my brain
                        a break.
                    </p>
                    <p>But that's not entirely accurate. Watching shows uses up much more energy than reading a book. I can
                        remember back to when I was a kid and I would rather have picked up a book than watched a movie.
                        Our brains get used to one type of stimulation. Reading has been proven to be the best for us. And
                        the best stress reliever.
