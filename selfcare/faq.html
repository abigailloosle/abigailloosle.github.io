            <p class="question">What does selfcare mean?</p>
            <p class="response">
              The whole concept of self care is about taking time for yourself, to hit pause, to reset your priorities, all that good stuff.
              Really, it is meant to boost your productivity. Sometimes, our world around us throws us into a space where
              we can't really be positive. But I have found that it is
              <em>essential</em> to make time, and space, for positivity.

          <div class="question-container">
            <p class="question">Why does self care matter?</p>
            <p class="response">
              Self care helps you access the best parts of your personality. No one can be a giver, or focusing on others, all the time.
              You need time for you. So, make a date with yourself! You won't be disappointed.

            <p class="question">How can I tell if I am doing enough?</p>
            <p class="response">
              Everyone is different, so what
              <em>my right amount</em> of self care may be will likely not be the same for you. But we can learn from one another.
              I like to ask myself, "In the last 3 days, what have I done for myself?" If the answer is, "Not much," I know
              I've got some work to do.

              Well, hello! My name is Abby Loosle. I am a college student and I’m like you (I imagine). I used to worry and stress all
              the time, and depending on who you ask, I still do! What matters is that I’m trying. I’ve gained some useful
              tips that I am happy to share and maybe even lighten your burdern.

            <p class="question">What makes you an expert on self care?</p>
            <p class="response">
              Nada! Aren't you glad you stopped by? One thing that I've always enjoyed is finding new ways of taking care of myself. I've
              got a few years of that under my belt. At every stage in our lives, the amount we can give/spoil/pamper ourselves
              is bound to be different. I am happy to share what I've picked up along the way! If it's not your cup of tea,
              then I wish you the best!

            <p class="question">Where do you get this stuff?</p>
            <p class="response">
              The simple answer is the internet. A more deep answer is a cup of Pinterest, a dash of friends, and a pinch of everywhere
              else. I also get ideas from people smarter than me (aka they've writen a book) and other people who I trust.

            <p class="response">
              Thank goodness, I thought I was the only one. I do like to dabble in some DIY projects, and you can check out some of them
              on the
              <a href="activities.html">Activities</a> page. Self care doesn't have to mean $$$ lots of your paycheck goes towards it. You just need
              to be willing to put in the time!
