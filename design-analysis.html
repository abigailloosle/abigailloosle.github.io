            Each design principle needs three items:
            1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
            2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
            3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

          <h3>Proximity &mdash; Kristy Prince</h3>
            <img src="proxim.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use" href="proxim.png">
            <p>
                Proximity is a design principle that pulls from grouping and white space. This image show how this sight uses grouping with boundaries to guide our eyes to these specific images. This grouping also helps the user easily find things that are closely related to each other because they are near each other in the grouping. White space is also found in the image as the two groups are separated by a uniform about of white space as well as the images themselves. This helps the user identify the two separate groups easily and makes it easier for them to  find the specific image they are looking for easily. The user that is visiting this site can also know that when he clicks on an image in the “shop for gifts” area they will be directed to different gifts they could potentially buy and not find, for example, a template for a crocheting project.

         <h3>Typography &mdash; Marissa Page </h3>

            <p>
                Typography is the primary method of delivering content to the viewer, so it’s clear why it’s so important to get right. This is a good example of typography because even though this is being viewed on a phone, the fonts have adjusted to be big enough to read without any trouble. Despite the fact that they only used one sans-serif font, they still added variety by using different weights. It’s true that it isn’t usually good to center too much text, but in this case centered text goes along with the theme, and they don’t overuse it. One advantage of sans-serif fonts is that it it is a very easy font to recognize words at a glance. This increases usability as well because users are able to quickly find what they’re looking for.
