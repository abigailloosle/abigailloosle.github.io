# More about the Weather page

I built this [page](https://abigailloosle.github.io/weather/) as a challenege to access a Weather API and the user's location. I wanted to accomplish this with JSON and Ajax to load the page asynchronously.

## Why Franklin and Greenville?

I added a few random cities as static pages, these were built first. Once I got these pages functioning, and accessing the data through the API, I moved on to the page to access your location.

### The Main Page

So in order for this page to access your location, you have to allow the browser to use your location. And then make sure your page is loading the scripts.

## Searching

If you wanted to look up a location in any city (in the United States) this page lets you access that information! Just simply enter the city you'd like to see and it will pull up that information.
